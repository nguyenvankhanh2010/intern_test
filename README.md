This is a Spring Boot-based application designed to manage exam scores by loading data from a large CSV file (`diem_thi_thpt_2024.csv`) into an H2 in-memory database and providing a web interface to view the data. The application leverages Thymeleaf for templating, supports batch processing for large datasets.
